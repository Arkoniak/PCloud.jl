Length of 0 means lock until the end of file (no matter how big it grows).\n\nThe offset of this method could be interpreted depending on whence parameter:- 0: offset is from the start of the file\n\n1: offset is from current offset\n2: offset is from the end of the file\n\nIf the parameter get is set, then instead of acquiring the lock only a test is performed if the file region can be locked.\n\nBy default locks are blocking, that is the call will block until the lock is granted (except when get is set or request is for unlocking). If you do not wish the lock to block, set the noblock parameter.\n\nLocks are advisory locks, that is, they are not enforced on readers/writers that are not trying to take a lock.\n\nYou may hold just one lock on a file region. If shared lock is to be converted to an exclusive lock, the conversion is not atomic - the shared lock MIGHT be released first, before acquiring the exclusive lock. That happens only if the request for the exclusive lock can not be satisfied at the moment. This is done to prevent two processes from deadlocking by first holding a shared lock on a file and later trying to convert it to an exclusive lock.

Result will be 0 regardless if lock was granted or not.\n\nOne should check the return field locked to see if lock was granted. Unlocking always sets locked to true, the same goes for blocking requests, as they are always successful (sooner or later).\n\nSo with result of 0 checking the value of locked makes sense only for non-blocking locks and for get checks.\n\nOutput Example\n\n{\n    result: 0,\n    locked: true\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#PCloud.file_open","page":"Home","title":"PCloud.file_open","text":"file_open(client::PCloudClient; kwargs...)\n\nOpens a file descriptor.\n\nSource: https://docs.pcloud.com/methods/fileops/file_open.html\n\nArguments\n\nflags::Int: which can be a combination of the file_open flags.\n\nOptional Arguments\n\npath::String: path to the file, for which the file descirptior is created.\nfileid::Int: id of the folder, for which the file descirptior is created.\nfolderid::Int: id of the folder, in which new file is created and file descirptior is returned.\nname::String: name of the file, in which new file is created and file descirptior is returned.\n\nThe use of these parameters, depends on the flags are given.

Blocking only works when diffid is provided and does not work with either after or last.\n\nHowever, sending any additional data on the blocked connection will unblock the request and an empty set will be returned. This is useful when you want to monitor for updates when idle and use connection for other activities when needed.\n\nJust keep in mind that if you send any request on a connection that is blocked, you will receive two replies - one with empty set of updates and one answering your second request.\n\nIf the optional limit parameter is provided, no more than limit entries will be returned.\n\nIMPORTANT When a folder/file is created/delete/moved in or out of a folder, you are supposed to update modification time of the parent folder to the timestamp of the event.\n\nIMPORTANT If your state is more than 6 months old, you are advised to re-download all your state again, as we reserve the right to compact data that is more than 6 months old.\n\nCompacting means that if a deletefolder/deletefile event is more than 6 month old, it will disappear altogether with all create/modify events. Also, if modifyfile is more than 6 months old, it can become createfile and the original createfile will disappear.

Set your current diffid to the provided diffid after you process all events, during processing set your state to the diffid of the event preferably in a single transaction with the event itself.\n\nEach object will have at least:\n\ndiffid::Int: the event's identificator\ntime::datetime: timestamp of the event\nevent::event: see the possible events here\n\nIn most cases also metadata will be provided.\n\ndiffid could be used to request updates since this event. Normally diffids are incrementing integers, but one can not assume that ids are consecutive as events that cancel each other (e.g. createfolder, deletefolder) are not displayed if they happen to be in the same list.\n\nFor shares, a share object is provided.\n\ntime of the event is the time of the event - even if the event is createfolder, time is not guaranteed to be the folder's creation time.
